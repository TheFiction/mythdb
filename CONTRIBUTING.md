# Contributing

Any one willing to contribute to the project is allowed to do so as long as they are complaint with the guidelines 
and interested in trying out new ways.

## Submitting Issues and Patches

Since the project is in its preliminary stages there aren't any definitive guidelines on submitting issues or features.
We are delighted to discuss and include any features which alings with the projects goals and ideology.

## Writing Code

Coding is fun, but a code that doesn't follow a proper format is a nightmare to many.

We looked at different industry standard coding styles and best practices, but figured out the best ones are produced by Google, undoubtely.
So, we adopted these practices to make sure our code doesn't just become a piece of archaic document.

If your contribution contains code, please make sure that it follows
[the style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/).
Otherwise we will have to ask you to make changes, and that's no fun for anyone.
